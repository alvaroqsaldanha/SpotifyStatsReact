# Your Spotify Statistics

A google chrome extension being developed with ReactJS, CSS and using Spotify's RESTful Web API. 

This README will be updated with installing instructions soon. Currently, the extension's beta is awaiting approval from Google. Without it, it's not possible to install the extension for third-party API use in a production environment, as it needs a fixed ID to be registered in the Spotify app's dashboard for every machine. 

Here are some screenshots of the current version :) :
