# Your Spotify Statistics

A google chrome extension being developed with ReactJS, CSS and using Spotify's RESTful Web API. 

This README will be updated with installing instructions soon. Currently, the extension is awaiting approval from Google. Without it, it's not possible to install it for third-party API use in a production environment, as it needs a fixed ID for every machine.
